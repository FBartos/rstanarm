<h4>Bayesian applied regression modeling</h4></span>

<br>

**rstanarm** is an R package that emulates other R model-fitting functions but
uses Stan (via the [rstan](http://mc-stan.org/rstan/) package)
for the back-end estimation. The primary target audience is people who would be
open to Bayesian inference if using Bayesian software were easier but would use
frequentist software otherwise.
