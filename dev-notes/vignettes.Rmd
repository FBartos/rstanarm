# Vignettes

This should be pretty straightforward if you use the existing vignettes as a template. You should cover the following,

1. Mathematically define the posterior distribution of the model.
2. An example using simulated data.
3. An example using real data.

In both examples above you should,

* Inspect the data.
* Fit a couple of models.
* Run a posterior predictive checks (e.g. `pp_check`).
* Do basic model comparison with `loo`.

Where possible use existing templates in `vignettes/children`. You can include them with:
```
{r, child="children/*.txt"}
```
