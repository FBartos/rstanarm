# An outline of what goes where

A brief description of what (generally) goes into each the various files/folders.

**`/R`**

* Contains all the model functions and corresponding .fit functions (e.g. `stan_glm` and `stan_glm.fit`).  

**`/exec`** and **`/inst/chunks`**

* The `/inst/chunks` folder contains reusable snippits of Stan code. The `/exec` folder contains the Stan models that are used in the relevant R function. For example, `continuous.stan` contains all the models that can be declared by `stan_glm` (as well as some others). You can view the compiled model in R by executing `rstanarm:::stanmodels$continuous`.

**`data`**

* Example data used in the examples/tests.

**`man-roxygen`**

* Templates for documentation.

**`man`**

* Don't edit any documentation here (changes will get overwritten when rebuilding the package).

**`tests/testthat`**

* Tests run using the [testthat](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html) package.

**`R/misc.R`**

* Contains a bunch of helper functions.
